# Mozo 
_An app that creates tickets with products and prints it with a bluetooth thermal printer. Those products are read from a json database determined by the user._

# Usage ✅
_Althought the app has a specific use by one person, it's avalaible for proofs and use if u need :)_

# Funcionality ⚙️ 
_Mozo was completely builded with Flutter and this packages:_
* [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) - A state manager.
* [Bluetooth Print](https://pub.dev/packages/bluetooth_print) - To use bluetooth and connect the external device.
* [HTTP](https://pub.dev/packages/http) - This package allows you to make http requests and consume APIs.
* [Shared Preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) - Used for data persistence.
* [Permission Handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) - This package helped make the request for permission to use location and bluetooth explicit, which is required in Android 10+.

_i also used firebase to create the example database._
